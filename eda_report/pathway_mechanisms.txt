  Context: We initially sought to understand how human mutant tau influences Aβ neuropathology in the APP/PS1xTau22 transgenic model....

tau --[upregulates]--> amyloid
  Context: ( F ) Confocal micrographs of phospho-tau and axon-specific markers, AT8 and SMI312, respectively, show that the number of AT8 + puncta ( G ) and SMI3...

tau --[binds]--> amyloid
  Context: Phospho-tau epitopes associated with more mature tau lesions, as revealed by antibodies AT100 and PHF1, were also more abundant in the hippocampus and...

tau --[binds]--> amyloid
  Context: Given that the scope of tau pathology is tightly associated with the severity of neuron loss and cognitive symptoms in AD, we investigated whether amy...

  Context: Given that the scope of tau pathology is tightly associated with the severity of neuron loss and cognitive symptoms in AD, we investigated whether amy...

tau --[regulates]--> amyloid
  Context: This phenotype was specific to the presence of tau pathology but was not influenced by amyloid coexpression....

APP --[binds]--> tau
  Context: As a result, the APP/PS1xTau22 mouse model does not exactly replicate the sequence, pace and interactions of Aβ and tau generation, deposition and cle...

APP --[binds]--> amyloid
  Context: As a result, the APP/PS1xTau22 mouse model does not exactly replicate the sequence, pace and interactions of Aβ and tau generation, deposition and cle...

tau --[upregulates]--> IL-6
  Context: AGE-tau was shown to generate high levels of ROS, resulting in nuclear translocation of p65/p50 dimers and consequently increased IL-6, APP, and Aβ pr...

APP --[downregulates]--> tau
  Context: In APP/PS-1 mice, forsythoside B (FTS•B) exerts an anti-NF-κB effect and reduces Aβ plaque formation, tau phosphorylation, and microglial activation, ...

APOE --[downregulates]--> amyloid
  Context: Genetic removal or reduction of mouse or human APOE3 and APOE4 in AD models reduces beta‐amyloid (Aβ) plaques....

APOE --[downregulates]--> amyloid
  Context: Our findings show that potent downregulation of CNS APOE with siRNAs, even after the onset of cellular changes, strikingly reduces amyloid pathology i...

APOE --[downregulates]--> amyloid
  Context: Our findings show that potent downregulation of CNS APOE with siRNAs, even after the onset of cellular changes, strikingly reduces amyloid pathology i...

APOE --[downregulates]--> amyloid
  Context: Compared to controls, silencing Apoe with di‐siRNA APOE reduced APP6E10 positive plaque burden (female: 86%, p < 0.0001; male: 70%, p = 0.0158) (Figur...

APOE --[regulates]--> amyloid
  Context: We injected (ICV) 9‐week‐old 5xFAD mice with 237 μg of di‐siRNA 56 APOE or di‐siRNA NTC (control) and measured brain Apoe expression, amyloid burden, ...

APP --[cleaves]--> amyloid
  Context: APP processing on the cell membrane produces α‐CTFs by a non‐amyloidogenic pathway, and β‐CTFs via an amyloidogenic pathway....

APP --[downregulates]--> amyloid
  Context: These results suggest that long‐term silencing of Apoe may decrease APP protein stability and may reduce the production of amyloid fragments via both ...

APP --[regulates]--> PA
  Context: Aβ, amyloid beta; APP, amyloid precursor protein; CTF, carboxy‐terminal fragment; di‐siRNA, divalent small interfering RNA; NTC, non‐targeting (vehicl...

APP --[inhibits]--> amyloid
  Context: Mechanistically, our findings suggest that, when present, Apoe modulates APP levels, serves as a scaffold for plaque formation, and prevents immune‐me...

APP --[cleaves]--> BACE1
  Context: , 45 91
The Apoe ‐dependent reduction in APP and amyloid CTFs we observed was surprising, particularly as there was no effect on the expression of APP...
